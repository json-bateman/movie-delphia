## How to get started on this repo

If I was cool I'd make a dockerfile that started both the frontend and backend and did some logging
shenanigans, but I'm not cool ok? I'll set it up later perhaps wink. 

For now: 

```
cd react-frontend
pnpm run dev

cd ../go-backend
go run .
```

If its the initial time running the repo, you also need to `go mod tidy` in the go-backend folder to
download and install the dependencies.
